I hurt inside a little when people tell me they don't have time to read, usually with a slightly embarassed and apologetic tone. 

"I don't know the last time that I've read a book," or, "given the choice in the hour I have a day after putting my children to bed if I decide to play a video game or watch [fill-in-the-blank critically acclaimed HBO series], I'll play a video game." 

I get it. Really. Our lives and lifestyles are complicated, busy, evolving. Our needs for grounding and calm differ. As much as it pains me to say it, the novel is no longer tied to leisure time. It's tied to commuting time or a vacation.

My personal growth is intertwined with books. They're inspiration for ideas and connection to people, cultures, and history. When I've found that I haven't had space in my life to read - there were a few years when I read maybe 3-4 books - I find that something is missing. And I distinctly remember my last semester in college. While I was busting my ass to finish my degree and taking really difficult political science courses in ethnic conflict during the day, I rationed an Anthony Bourdain book to a chapter a night. It was so hard to stop reading, but it was a gift to myself. The pleasure in escape was critical to maintaining my sanity.

And in full transparency, I'm a multitasker. While I'm knitting, while I'm picking up the bouse I listen to books. While I'm watching Murder, She Wrote, I'm programming or knitting. And while I'm at a bar with my dog, I'm reading a book. 

But perhaps more than anything though, I love to talk to people about what they're interested it. I love finding out about retcons in video games (I know nothing about video games btw), what YouTube show your kid just loves right now, what your therapist recommended this week. I thrive off recommendations, and I've found that people love to share about what they're interested in right now. And I consider reading a synonym to thinking. It's something that asks us to go just a little beyond the superficial, ask questions, make connections. 

You don't have to read 30, 40, 50, 100 books a year, watch French films from the 1960s, read longform New Yorkers, watch the new Showtime series, or listen to the right podcasts every morning AND while you're working out. No one has time for this. 

Give yourself the space to think about a book, a film, the way a website you interact with makes you feel, a piece of art, the alienation of an airport lounge, an album that meant the world to you when you were 17. 

Everything can be read, everything can be given up for interpretation. Someone intended meaning, and that intention is out there for dissection via surgical instrument or dirty kitchen knife.

Think of this as a place to ask questions. To reminisce. To tie to those loose ends up. Psychotherapy for your podcast or Netflix habit.

Let's do it. Let's read. It's a little bit personal, a little cultural theory, a little lit crit, over the top at times, woefully underedited, underproofread at others. Raw, over-achieving, irritating.

Give yourself the space to think about a book, a film, the way a website you interact with makes you feel, a piece of art, the alienation of an airport lounge, an album that meant the world to you when you were 17. 

Everything can be read, everything can be given up for interpretation. Someone intended meaning, and that intention is out there for dissection via surgical instrument or dirty kitchen knife.

Think of this as a place to ask questions. To reminisce. To tie to those loose ends up. Psychotherapy for your podcast or Netflix habit.

Let's do it. Let's read. It's a little bit personal, a little cultural theory, a little lit crit, over the top at times, woefully underedited, underproofread at others. Raw, over-achieving, irritating.

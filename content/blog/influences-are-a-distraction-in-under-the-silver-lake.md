title: Nostalgia and influence in Under the Silver Lake
description: >-
  Under the Silver Lake is a peculiar follow up for David Robert Mitchell, the
  director behind the chilling, strangely nostalgic horror film It Follows. But
  when are the influences of a work more a distraction than homage? And when are
  influences more important than the author or influencer? And is it Scotty
  Ferguson's Vertigo nightmare? Also, motherfucking David Yow.

_Under the Silver Lake_ is not the follow-up to _It Follo_ws we were probably all anticipating. It has the pacing and ominous, languorous zooming of everyday objects or people that seem to be hallmarks of Mitchell's style. There are moments in _It Follows_ that make us feel like we're in some horror nostalgia wet dream, no time and the 80s, 90s, 00s, and 10s at once. Seashell phones that don't exist and have never existed. 

Even though Mitchell starts to ground viewers in the visual language of _UTSL_ - colorful, flashing animal icons, cutting to the interior of a coffee shop window with graffiti'd "BEWARE THE DOG KILLER," then panning over past a man wearing a shirt with the same animal icons. _UTSL_ still makes us feel that this is the LA of now. Yet something is amiss, and only Sam (Andrew Garfield) can see it.

In a nutshell, the film is an existential noir, following Sam, a writer desperate to find meaning in secret messages in songs and hidden patterns in the letters Vanna White turns in Wheel of Fortune, as he tries to unravel the mystery of his missing neighbor, Sarah (Riley Keough). He's conspiracy-obsessed, and when he connects Sarah's disappearance to the death of a local tycoon, he's the one who can only crack the code and find her.

The film is darkly and absurdly comedic, laugh out loud funny with odes to Pynchon, DeLillo, Robert Altman's _The Long Goodbye_, and even _The Big Lewbowski_. When Sam follows a group of women from his apartment to Echo Park Lake and then to a hotel, a directorial nod to Scotty following Madeline in _Vertigo_, he's driving a Black Mustang with a dick drawn on hood. Sam and an unnamed actress (Riki Lindholm) are fucking while women's tennis plays on a TV next to them. The Homeless King (David Yow) leads Sam through a park, explaining that "coyotes are blessed creatures. When you see a coyote, you don't run away. You follow it. See where it takes you." This, as a coyote is digging through the trash, selects a bag of Doritos, and takes it back into the woods. When he meets The Songwriter (Jeremy Bobb), a Man Behind the Curtain archetype with a Randy Newman sense of humor, The Songwriter explains that he wrote "Smells Like Teen Spirit", "somewhere between a blow job and an omelette. There's no rebellion. There's only me earning a paycheck."

I read _UTSL_ as a total schizophrenic love of film and very fraught relationships with Los Angeles and the film industry that created a movie. There's a songwriter

Sometimes, influences can become a distraction. A forced attempt to look smart, well-read, to say, "I've seen the right films and want you to know I know Antonioni without saying it."  Admittedly, I loved this about _Under the Silver Lake._ Upon first watch, I was trying to catch all the references that were turned on their heads but still reverent. But if don't know the references, and I certainly didn't catch them all, the film could probably be alienating, confusing, or just simply unlikeable. On second watch, I read the film as modern noir, helping me to make sense of part of our culture's recent obsession with serial killers and true crime. We want to make sense of bigger pictures and larger mysteries. We want a challenge, something dark, and when we don't find it in an obvious way, maybe we create something out of nothing.

When Sam goes to visit his friend, an unnamed bar buddy played by Topher Grace in Victor Heights, it was two blocks from my old house in LA. I sent a screengrab of the house to my brother who lives in the same house. And here's what he sent back. That scene, filmed probably not even two years ago, was at a place that no longer exists.

Maybe the point is this: nostalgia is fucked. When Andrew Garfield drives past the Intelligensia at Sunset Junction with Bernard Herrmann-esque score playing, it is funny. It's not deep. There used to be something there, and now it's fucking dead. As his friend says, "We crave mystery because there's none left." 

That, or maybe Mitchell just really, really hates living near the dog park in Silver Lake.

 , that seems to a, the movies comprising that allowed that movie to be created. Fans of _It Follows_ were likely disappointed, missing references to Harmony Korine and Chloe Sevigny, _Vertigo_, _Sunset Boulevard_.

How do you know that this is a movie that shouldn’t be writte or made. Is self-indulgence as personal exploartion in a film too much?

I may have been the only one who read it this way, but I'm convinced _Under the Silver Lake_ is an attempt to depict what's happening underneath Scotty's catatonic state in Alfred Hitchcock's _Vertigo._ And if you've never seen Vertigo, you're in for a treat. Also, it might help you give _Under the Silver Lake_ a chance_._

The blonde and the brunette - every David Lynch film ever, the music very Herrman.

What we don’t know is that Silverlake as a big dog park too. When you think it’s time to make your LA movie, Hollywood movie, and you want it to be so smart, so many refererences, wearing everything on your sleeve, maybe get some advice. Except fo LA La Land, which everyone can fuck off about, it was charming, and good, and you felt the hair on your arms stand up at least once - admit it. It’s good. But that film is rare.

Same thing here except the nostalgia is nostalgia.

title: Influences are a distraction in Under the Silver Lake
description: >-
  Under the Silver Lake is a peculiar follow up for David Robert Mitchell, the
  director behind the chilling, strangely nostalgic It Follows. But when are the
  influences of a work more a distraction than homage? And when are influences
  more important than the author or influencer? And is it Scotty Ferguson's
  Vertigo nightmare?

I've been listening to a lot of Joan as Policewoman lately. And it's unfortunate that she can rarely be talked about without someone mentioning her late boyfriend, Jeff Buckley. But I get it. That's how press works, and trauma sells.

So of course, it's hard for me to listen to her without thinking of him. I've listened to _Grace_ over and over, I know that album front and back. I've sat in a silent room after someone put on the album, listening to it in its entirety as my musician friends and I anticipated the breath before Buckley begins Hallelujah, hummed the solos note for note in Grace, and screamed along to Eternal Life. 

The album was just so lush and new, and the influences that Buckley would cite in interviews, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Cocteau Twins, and Big Star, became influences and loves for me. His reference points went beyond mere influence - yes, I can imagine him singing loudly along with Elizabeth Fraser now, and yes, his vocal gymnastics make a lot of sense after listening to _Treasure_, but does Grace at any point sound like a Cocteau Twins record? No. It doesn't. It's those influences, those references, creative collaboration, and a fucking talented angel voiced musician who made _Grace_ possible.

But sometimes, influences can become a distraction. An forced attempt to look smart, well-read, to say, "I've seen the right films and want you to know I know them without saying it." This is how I felt about Under the Silver Lake. It \
A schizophrenic love of film  



The Harmony Korine, Chloe Sevigny thing is so good. Leaving and sitting on Hitchcock’s grave



David Lynch, Don DiLillo, Thomas Pynchon, John Carpenter’s They Live

How do you know that this is a movie that shouldn’t be writte or made. Is self-indulgence as personal exploartion in a film too much? 



I wrote Smells Like Teen Spirit somewhere between a blow job and an omelette.



Fight Club sscore



Cronenberg





It’s a problem when a movie is the sum of its influences, after tallied



DOA - the five days, getting sick



Watching this after a motorcycle certification course. I’ve had two glasses of wine, some weed, and I just feel my body still moving, that same feeling of being on rollercoasters all day. I can feel the cluth releases lightly in the friction zone.



There are moments in in It Fllows makes us understand we are in some nostalgia wet dream - no time and the 80s, 90s, 00s, and 10s at once. But everything in UTSL makes us feel that this is ht eLA of now. But something is amiss, and only Anderew GArfield can se ti.



Big Lebowski.



Janet Gaynor



The blonde and the brunette - every David Lynch film ever, the music very Herrman.



What we don’t know is that Silverlake as a big dog park too. When you think it’s time to make your LA movie, Hollywood movie, and you want it to be so smart, so many refererences, wearing everything on your sleeve, maybe get some advice. Except fo LA La Land, which everyone can fuck off about, it was charming, and good, and you felt the hair on your arms stand up at least once - admit it. It’s good. But that film is rare.



Southland Tales And k



He searches for npm lmao



Same thing here except the nostalgia is nostalgia.



THe house band being low key like Julee Cruise in Twin Peaks.

title: Nostalgia and influence in Under the Silver Lake
description: >-
  Under the Silver Lake is a peculiar follow up for David Robert Mitchell, the
  director behind the chilling, strangely nostalgic It Follows. But when are the
  influences of a work more a distraction than homage? And when are influences
  more important than the author or influencer? And is it Scotty Ferguson's
  Vertigo nightmare?

I may have been the only one who read it this way, but I'm convinced _Under the Silver Lake_ is an attempt to depict what's happening underneath Scotty's catatonic state in Alfred Hitchcock's _Vertigo._ And if you've never seen Vertigo, you're in for a treat. Also, it might help you give _Under the Silver Lake_ a chance_._

It's the not the follow up we were probably all anticipating. It has the pacing and ominous, languorous zooming of everyday objects or people that seem to be hallmarks of Mitchell's style. There are moments in _It Follows_ that make us feel like we're in some horror nostalgia wet dream, no time and the 80s, 90s, 00s, and 10s at once. Seashell phones that don't exist and have never existed. Even though Mitchell starts to ground viewers in the visual language of UTSL - colorful, flashing animal icons, cutting to the interior of a coffee shop window with graffiti'd "BEWARE THE DOG KILLER," then panning over past a man wearing a shirt with the same animal icons. UTSL still makes us feel that this is the LA of now. Yet something is amiss, and only Sam (Andrew Garfield) can see it.

The film is darkly comedic, laugh out loud funny in an absurd, Pynchon way. In an ode to Scotty following Kim Novak in Vertigo, Garfield follows a group of women from his apartment to Echo Park Lake and then to a hotel He's driving a Black Mustang with a dick drawn on it. Sam and an actress are fucking, while the actress comments on the Kurt Cobain poster hanging above the bed. Women's tennis plays on a TV next to them. For some reason, I wrote "I wrote Smells Like Teen Spirit somewhere between a blow job and an omelette" while watching this scene. Sam dances to What's the Frequency, Kenneth, an REM song based on an incident where Dan Rather was attacked by a man shouting conspiracy theories.

 Zooming in on a dead Bichon Frise

The Hitchcock references are ripe: Sam watching his neighbors with binoculars like James Stewart in Rear Window, his Psycho and Rear Window posters in his living room,. And the noir references



Sometimes, influences can become a distraction. A forced attempt to look smart, well-read, to say, "I've seen the right films and want you to know I know Antonioni without saying it."  Admittedly, I loved this about _Under the Silver Lake._ The influences were turned on their heads, reverent but if you don't know the references, and I certainly didn't catch them all, the film could probably be alienating, confusing, or just simply unlikeable. 

I read it as a total schizophrenic love of film and fraught relationships with Los Angeles and the film industry that created a movie , that seems to a, the movies comprising that allowed that movie to be created. Fans of _It Follows_ were likely disappointed, missing references to Harmony Korine and Chloe Sevigny, _Vertigo_, _Sunset Boulevard_. 



1935 Duesenberg, a car famously owned by Gary Cooper, the history of the dog killer rooted in film studios that used to operate out of Edendale in the Silver Lake neighborhood.

Jesus and the Brides, an East LA band that play at private parties and are on the cover of the LA Weekly

When Sam goes to visit his friend in Victor Heights, my old neighborhood in my LA, I sent a screengrab of the house to my brother. And here's what he sent back. That scene, filmed probably not even two years ago, was at a place that no longer exists.

Maybe the point is this: nostalgia is fucked. When Andrew Garfield drives past the Intelligensia at Sunset Junction with Bernard Herrmann-esque score playing, it is funny. It's not deep. There used to be something there, and now it's fucking dead. That, or maybe Mitchell just really, really hates living near the dog park in Silver Lake.

The Harmony Korine, Chloe Sevigny thing is so good. Leaving and sitting on Hitchcock’s grave

How do you know that this is a movie that shouldn’t be writte or made. Is self-indulgence as personal exploartion in a film too much? 

I wrote Smells Like Teen Spirit somewhere between a blow job and an omelette.

Fight Club sscore

Cronenberg

It’s a problem when a movie is the sum of its influences, after tallied

DOA - the five days, getting sick

Watching this after a motorcycle certification course. I’ve had two glasses of wine, some weed, and I just feel my body still moving, that same feeling of being on rollercoasters all day. I can feel the cluth releases lightly in the friction zone.

Big Lebowski.

Janet Gaynor

The blonde and the brunette - every David Lynch film ever, the music very Herrman.

What we don’t know is that Silverlake as a big dog park too. When you think it’s time to make your LA movie, Hollywood movie, and you want it to be so smart, so many refererences, wearing everything on your sleeve, maybe get some advice. Except fo LA La Land, which everyone can fuck off about, it was charming, and good, and you felt the hair on your arms stand up at least once - admit it. It’s good. But that film is rare.

Southland Tales And k

He searches for npm lmao

Same thing here except the nostalgia is nostalgia.

THe house band being low key like Julee Cruise in Twin Peaks.
